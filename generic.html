								<h2>A Podcast by Yours Truly</h2>
								<p> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shea-hacker/t-shaped-podcast">This is our podcast</a> </p>

								<h2>What We Garnered from This Experience</h2>
								<p>When the Mega Team came to fruition on the first group project it was unclear whether we would succeed in our goal of describing the concept of the VT shaped student or we would fail miserably. Would we effectively emulate what being a VT shaped student entailed or would we fall short? As we embarked on our journey we got together and starting to toss around ideas on what being a VT shaped student meant to us. As we each spoke about our majors, the classes we were enrolled in, our extra-curricular activities and everything in between we learned there were not only different versions of the VT shaped student but there were so many components that comprised a VT shaped student.</p>
								<p> Although, we conducted our podcast effectively and seemed to meet the criteria of the assignment for the podcast, we did not reach excellence we fell short. Boo, Mega Team! Despite this podcast effectively explaining our individual aspects of the VT shaped student we possessed as a group we fell short on creativity. Other groups utilized outside sources and did spinoffs of podcasts such as "Serial." Our podcast was somewhat monotnous and tedious although we did list our characteristics of the VT shaped student. </p>
								<p> To be fair as a group we were not very experienced in using Audacity the recording app that we utilized but that is why we are in this class isn't it. Writing and Digital media has forced me to step outside of my comfort zone as a review a podcast that I constructed as an English major, writing an essay in atom what a conundrum. But I digress I thought I was starting to get a handle on this class until the podcast which the Mega Team did not excel in. Professor Evia gives his honest opinion of our work, "As the mega team, I expected a little more from you, and you played it a little too safe," indicating that although we completed the assignment we lacked the "wow" factor. </p>
								<p> We should have tweaked the audio and made it clearer as well as incorporated some comedic or entertaining elements for the audience. Despite, our lack of experience with this software and this being all of our first podcast we did learn the importance of this project, which was the to describe the elements of the VT shaped student. For example, I divulge the extra-curricular and study abroad program that I will partake in that make up the V of my VT shaped student. As well all the members of the Mega Team divulge what makes up their cross of the T, horizontal T and enhanced T as they talk passionately about their majors and what led them to choose them at such a technologically base university like Virginia Tech. </p>
								<p> Overall, we definitely lacked the creative component we needed in this podcast which I think we totally redeemed ourselves for in our next project, the video. Despite, the lack of depth to our podcast we learned the core characteristics of a VT shaped student. </p>
