								<h2>A TASTY TWIST ON THE V SHAPED STUDENT</h2>
								<p> <a href="https://youtu.be/vX_FAIJnkjU">This is our video</a> </p>

								<h2>OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE V SHAPED STUDENT WAS DOWNRIGHT TASTY</h2>
								<p>As our group embarked on our next project, the video there was a lot of consideration put into the creative aspects. We went over all the ways we could incorporate the aspects of the V shaped student in an effective yet, interesting way. After long thought and deliberation the Mega Team decided to orchestrate a somewhat "Tasty" video. We were effective in including all the aspects of the V shaped student efficiently by combining both the "dry" ingredients and the "wet" ingredients. The "ingredients" that we included are as follows, 1. clubs 2. internships 3. connections 4. community service 5. job connection websites 6. field study 7. co-op 8. research experience 9. study abroad. </p>
								<p> In this Hokie video as we deemed the name, we baked chocolate chip cookies and labeled all the ingredients as components of the V shaped student. We realized that all the ingredients of the V shaped student were necessary to complete the VT shaped student module as well as make delicious chocolate chip cookies. The aspects that constructed these chocolate chip cookies were the dry ingredients: flour (clubs), baking soda (community service in Blacksburg), salt (community service outside of Blacksburg). The wet ingredients included, butter (internships), light brown sugar (co-ops), granulated sugar (research opportunities), eggs (capstone experience), vanilla extract (field study) and finally chocolate chips (study abroad). The ingredients of the chocolate chip allowed us to talk about the elements of the V shaped student in depth and effectively. </p>
								<p> The feedback we received from Professor Evia on this project was much more positive as opposed to our podcast. Professor Evia describes our video, "Excellent, fantastic metaphor, the cookie's ingredients represented all aspects of the V-shaped model," this improvement was what we as the Mega Team were hoping for. Professor Evia also pointed out that some teams only touched upon one or two of the topics related to the V-shaped student but we addressed them all which was refreshing to hear. We put a lot of work into this video to include all the important aspects of the V-shaped student and not leave anything out. We even made these cookies homemade we didn't merely get store bought ones. </p>
								<p> While the members of the Mega Team have completed or possess many characteristics that make up a V-shaped student we have not done some things that we will experience later hopefully, during our time here at Tech. Two members of the Mega Team will be going on study abroad trips within the next two semesters spreading the motto of the VT-shaped student in foreign countries. The Mega Team would also hope to experience aspects of the V-shaped student that may be more available to us during our junior and senior years such as, co-ops, research opportunities, capstone experiences and finally field studies. These aspects of the V-shaped student are essential to completing the overall module of the VT-shaped student when combined with the aspects of the T-shaped student. Our video completed an overarching explanation of the V-shaped student that emphasized the importance of these crucial characteristics that were the ingredients of the cookies.</p>
