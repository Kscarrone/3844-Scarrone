								<h2>A POEM FOR THE VT SHAPED STUDENT</h2>
								<p> A poem by Holly Hokie yours truly</p>
<p>A poem about the Vt-shaped student noted duly</p>
<p>So what is the purpose of this very motto</p>
<p>To be upheld by students as they work on auto?</p>
<p>Pilot of the plane in control of our destiny</p>
<p>But I am an english major what distinguishes you from me?</p>
<p>Is it that you are an engineer at a technology based university? </p>
<p>That is part of what makes your T in reality</p>
<p>But what about the V that is just as essential</p>
<p>Co-ops, study abroad, field studies, and capstone experience all create potential</p>
<p>For you to be a well-rounded VT-shaped student</p>
<p>You have the power to possess both the V and the T if you are only so prudent</p>
<p>But is it effective this Vt-shaped student module that we encourage</p>
<p>Or is it merely a motto that makes students in different majors burn bridges</p>
<p>Personally for me, Holly Hokie</p>
<p>I would have to disagree</p>
<p> believe that students can learn a lot about themselves and others by adopting this strategy</p>
<p>If they use the Vt-shaped module in their everyday lives they can utilize it effectively</p>
<p>As I reflect on the purpose of the Vt-shaped student I sit and ponder</p>
<p>Why does the Vt-shaped student module not get more notoriety I have to wonder?</p>
<p>It accentuates all the respectable traits of Hokies at Tech</p>
<p>If you donâ€™t emulate the ideals of the Vt-shaped student it truly would be a wreck</p>
<p>A devastation in fact</p>
<p>The Vt-shaped student module keeps you well-rounded and on track </p>

								<h2>Why I Support the Vt-Shaped Student Module</h2>
								<p> I think the Vt-shaped student module is very important for students to learn about because many individuals do not know that it exists but possess many of the characteristics that truly make one. I believe that technology should be incorporated into student's learning despite major. Being an english major one might think that I would not use technology but I use a computer everyday for work and am currently writing this in html as I construct my own website. It is important for individuals to be able to effectively use technology as we live in such a digital age however, in some majors they value technology so much that they lose sight of other aspects like the V-shaped individual's characteristics that truly make a well-rounded hokie. The Vt-shaped student module is great because it incorporates aspects of both the V and the T in order to effectively make better rounded students. Like Professor Evia once said anyone can construct a website but without content and the power of words and expression that website is just code. The T-shaped student module is merely code but incorporated with the V there is emphasis on adding content and freedom of expression. It is easy to be intimidated at a University like Virginia Tech when the majority of your classmates in your grade are engineers and there is a heavy emphasis on the math and sciences when you are pursuing a degree in the liberal arts. The amount of times someone has come up to me when I was doing homework for this class and said, "Wait, are you coding right now?" and continued rudely, "Aren't you an english major?" Well, yes I am an english major and I know how to code and I made my own website so I do emulate the full package of the VT-shaped student. Boom. </p>
