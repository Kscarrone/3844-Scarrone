											<h2>Kathleen Ann Scarrone</h2>
										</header>
										<p>This website has been created and orchestrated by yours truly, Kathleen Scarrone. I am a Literature and Language major here at Tech so I'm just experiencing digital writing for the first time in this course. If you had asked me to operate Atom during first semester I probably would have cried and moved to Alaska. However, with the help of Professor Evias and my good friend and classmate Kendall Daniels I hope to be able to create a website with links to other materials. To the right is a picture of me as a toddler with my cousin Jamie because it's funny.</p>

										<h3>Benny Marzano's</h3>
										<p>Benny Marzano's is a local pizza shop where I order slices of pizza that are as big as my head. I never order a slice of plain cheese pizza without a side of ranch and garlic sauce. Although, the pizza in Blacksburg can never truly compare to pizza I eat at home in New Jersey it is a better substitue than Papa John's. Mr. Marzano's is an amazing establishment and they should open a Benny's in Turner dining hall or Owens.</p>

										<h3>Delta Gamma Fraternity</h3>
										<p>As cliche as this sounds I am actually very involved in my sorority. I go all out for other organizations philanthropies because I truly enjoy the competitive, friendly nature but raising money and awareness for worthy causes like Service for Sight are the main reason I participate. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kathleen.scarrone/videos/vb.100002496122684/1121966694563191/?type=2&theater">Here is the link</a> to a philanthropy I competed in called Watermelon Bust for Feeding America. The video received a lot of notority for the cause of Feeding America! </p>

									</li>

										<img src="IMG_2351.jpg"></span>
										<h3>Hokie Football</h3>
										<p>I have people ask me all the time: "What even is a hokie?" and I obviously respond, "I am!" Like many other students here at Tech I am a season ticket holder and live for the energy at the football games here. If you have never been in the North End Zone for Enter Sandman you should consider transferring. In addition, if you have never given your best gobble rendition on a key play please consider moving to Alasa or somewhere far away. But honestly, when I think of Tech I always think of the school spirit surrounding the Hokies which, is one of the reasons I was so drawn to this school in the first place. #NoHokieLeftBehind</p>

								<p> “Develop large-scale, multi-function (research, education, engagement, philanthropy) partnerships with industry and community with significant potential for societal engagement, service and impact.” - Implementation Strategies for VT Knowledge</p>

	<p>“We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future,” said President Tim Sands - VT Shaped Student</p>

	<p>"The challenges of the future require the capacity to work in interdisciplinary teams, engage in critical and creative thinking, collaborate with diverse people, communicate effectively, and conduct oneself with a deep sense of ethics." - VT Shaped Discovery</p>

	<p>“To create these kinds of learners, it may be useful to remember that, alongside invention, we need to find both inspiration and imagination,” she wrote. - New Program to Highlight Enrichment Opportunities for Students</p>

	<p>"An artist who trained in the sciences, a scientist whose studies began with the arts: What made Leonardo and Galileo who they were had a great deal to do with how their education demanded that they learn, think, and see outside and across boundaries." - Liberal Arts Education and the VT-Shaped Learner</p>

	<p>Rikakis has engrained new buzz terms into the fabric of Tech’s plans: “destination areas,” “innovation districts” and “VT-shaped knowledge.”- Virginia Tech's Provost Orchestrating Change</p>

	<p> "Students at all levels will be mentored to develop a knowledge base and skills while they are immersed in a culture that unifies multiple disciplines in a field of study within the context of these crucial values." - VT Shaped Discovery </p>

	<p> "What is a liberal education? Is it something that is fundamentally distinct from, or, worse, at odds with, a “practical education”?" - Liberal Arts Education and the VT Shaped Learner </p>

	<p> “To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university’s motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).” - VT Shaped Student </p>

	<p> "We want our students to be able to think from art to science as Galileo did, from science to art as Leonardo did."- Liberal Arts Education and the VT Shaped Student </p>

	<p> "The "V" is achieved through a variety of intentional activities at Virginia Tech, including the curriculum itself through things like undergraduate research, a robust general education curriculum that allows for opportunities like internships and education abroad, and First Year Experiences courses to set students up for success from the beginning of their time here at Virginia Tech." - VT Shaped Student </p>

									<h2>What I Learned From This Glorious Project</h2>
									<p> As I stated earlier if you had told me at the beginning of this school year that I would be making a webpage I would have laughed in your face. However, here I am currently drafting my own website with the help of Professor Evias but it is mostly me!! The topic of the VT shaped student was a foreign one to me before I took this class but I find that it resounds with me as I am an English major more specifically a Literature and Language major at a University that is very geared toward the math and sciences and specifically engineering. Professor Evias brought up an excellent point one day in class when he spoke about a website created with code but it was lacking content and I feel that's where I come in I am the toppings on the pizza. In reality, without the content of a website code is merely code it has no significant value or symbol of worth. The VT Shaped Student is comprised of well-rounded individuals that not only excel in technological aspects but are also passionate people that are willing to embrace diversity and have a strong set of moral values. President Sands embraced the ideal of the VT shaped individual wholeheartedly as the T-shaped student already existed by the V made the model more enriched and specific to Virginia Tech as a whole. I think the most interesting and compelling thing I found about this project was that it was so hands on and forced me to be able to confidently work with HTML. I had no idea how to work HTML before this class. I honestly would freak out on some of my homework assignments and beg my computer science engineer friends to aid me with my work or at least break it down for me. However, once I realized that once you have a template the majority of the things you focus on are content based I was pleasantly surprised. I would be frustrated in the beginning when I would mess up my code or felt lost in the class but now every time I hit refresh and I change a portion of my format in my template it is like a mini victory. I would get very worried that I would accidently delete something and break my template and therefore the internet but it has been going rather swimmingly. The most challenging aspect of HTML was definitely trying to figure out how to put in a link to a website which, I found particularly trying. I am no longer intimidated by using HTML like I originally had been and it makes me feel smarter when I am working with atom. In the beginning it took a great deal of patience in order to complete these tasks in atom but now that I actually know how to use HTML affectively it is interesting. My notion of "digital writing" has drastically changed due to Unit 1 as I have always taken web content for granted now that I am aware how much effort goes into orchestrating a website I will appreciate the small intricacies.
